# Development Guidelines

## Documentation
- Keep README files updated with usage examples
- Document all command-line options
- Provide clear error messages and help text
- Include sample images and expected outputs

## Deployment
- Console tool should work cross-platform
- Include proper requirements files for each component
- Provide clear setup instructions

## User Experience
- Provide clear progress feedback
- Use intuitive command-line interfaces
- Include helpful error messages and suggestions
- Support both novice and advanced users

## Development Tips
1. Always test core changes with the console interface
2. Keep core library pure - no UI dependencies
3. Use type hints in core functions for better IDE support
4. Write tests for core functions (consider adding `tests/` directory)
5. Document new features in the interface

## Future Extensions
This structure makes it easy to add:
- **GUI Interface** (tkinter, PyQt, etc.)
- **REST API** (FastAPI, Django REST)
- **Desktop App** (Electron, PyInstaller)
- **Mobile App** (React Native, Flutter)
- **Command Line Tools** (different argument styles)
- **Batch Processing** (multiple GIFs at once)
- **Cloud Functions** (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
