# GIF Creation & Image Processing Guidelines

## Image Processing
- Always validate input images before processing
- Handle various image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling for corrupted or unsupported files
- Use Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation
- Optimize GIF output for file size while maintaining quality

## GIF Creation
- Support configurable frame rates and durations
- Allow custom frame ordering and selection
- Implement proper color palette optimization
- Handle transparency appropriately
- Provide progress feedback for long operations

## Security
- Validate all file inputs
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Limit file sizes to prevent memory exhaustion
- Handle temporary files securely

## Dependencies
- **Core**: Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- **Console**: Standard library only (preferred)
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-maintained

## Testing
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Test with various image formats and sizes
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Validate GIF output quality and file size
