# Giffer Tool Console - Project Overview

## Project Structure
This is a GIF creation tool with a console interface:
- **Console**: Command-line interface for batch GIF creation
- **Core**: Shared libraries for image processing and GIF creation

## File Organization
- Core functionality goes in `core/` directory
- Interface-specific code goes in `console/` directory
- Shared dependencies in root `requirements.txt`
- Interface-specific dependencies in subdirectory `requirements.txt`

## Architecture Principles
- Keep core library pure - no UI dependencies
- Console tool should remain simple and lightweight
- Each component has its own dependencies and requirements
- Easy maintenance: Changes to core logic automatically benefit the interface
