# Python Code Style & Standards

## Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## File Naming
- Use snake_case for Python files
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Batch files should be clearly named (e.g., `create_gif.bat`)

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Gracefully handle missing files or invalid inputs
- Validate user inputs thoroughly

## Performance
- Process images efficiently to avoid memory issues
- Implement progress indicators for long operations
- Consider batch processing for multiple files
- Optimize for both speed and memory usage

## Memory Management
- Process images in chunks when possible
- Clean up temporary files
- Monitor memory usage for large batch operations
- Implement proper resource cleanup
